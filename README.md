# Challenge-4-Quiz-Game

## Description
Create a Quiz based on all criteria we've learned from HTML, CSS, Javascript. The project was made using all three languages as well as Object-Oriented Programming. Unfortuantely I was not able to complete this challenge. I was only able to get the timer to work but despite amounts of research around MDN, W3schools, and Youtube for references, I was not able to get the app to begin the quiz and display the questions.I didn't have time to do any styling as trying to get the quiz running was my main focus. Hopefully I'll be able to make better progress and get it working right on my own time.
